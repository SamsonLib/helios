# Helios
**The idea was to create the most cursed language**
This is a Programming Language with still undifined grammar.

Helios is written in Rust and its my first Rust project (I don't like the language)


# Maybe possable example grammar:
[Example 1](example.txt)

# Todo
- [ ] Define grammar
- [ ] Add a parser
- [ ] Decide: Interpreter? Compiler? Source-to-Source Compiler?
- [ ] Implement that ^
